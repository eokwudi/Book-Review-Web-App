# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The app is called Vi3W and it is a relatively simple Python Flask app that hosts books and allows for a user to
access the isbn, title, author, and year that the book was written. Users can leave a review and a rating between
1 and 5 (decimals allowed). Be careful when writing the review because it cannot be deleted once submitted from the users end.
In order to see the review after it is submitted, immediately refresh the page to see it
(don't know why this is the case). API's available by replacing the word search in the url for whatever book is currently being viewed
with the word api and the isbn does not need to be changed. The only way to successfully logout of your session is to hit the logout
button on the search page. A Postgresql database was used.

The file contains a template folder that houses all the html pages used in the making of the app.

The application.py file contains various methods that when accessed will execute code that will allow for
user interaction to result in some action to be performed on the website. The names of the routes and the name of the
html pages have been named to be rather obvious as to what they pertain to and if that is not the case the code is robust and
the database's are conveniently named.

Again, this is pretty rough but its my first time making a web app using interactive modules!
